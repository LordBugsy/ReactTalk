Needed for Backend:

If you want only want to make sure the backend is working properly, make sure you're in the directory where you set your "server.js" file and use 
"node server.js" to check for any errors. If there are, fix them asap, other than that, you're good!

- npm install dotenv
- npm install cors
- npm install express
- npm install mongoose
- npm install axios
- npm install concurrently --save-dev (to run both frontend and backend at the same time with only 'npm run start')
    add " "start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"" " at the bottom of the "scripts" value in package.json and make sure server and client are set up properly.

Needed for Frontend:
- npm install react-router-dom
